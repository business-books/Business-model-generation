Strategic planning and <a href="https://businessmodel.cc/">business model generation PDF</a> is important for every business. One of the most popular tools is the Osterwalder business model. It is simple and effective, suitable for both developing and long-established companies. In this article we will talk about the history of the appearance of the model and analyze each block in detail.

What is Osterwalder's business model?

Osterwalder's Business Model (Business Model Canvas) is a strategic management tool used to describe the business models of new or already operating enterprises. It is a diagram of 9 blocks describing different business processes of the organization.

The model was created by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pinier. They gave a detailed description of the scheme in the book "Alexander Osterwalder & Yves Pigneur: The Business Model GenerationÂ».

Operating firms use the model to find new growth points, analyze competitors and determine the best practices for business development. There is a misconception that the tool is used in startups and small firms, but in fact it is used by such "giants" as IBM, Ericsson, Deloitte and many others.

At the planning stage of a startup, the use of Canvas is difficult. Filling in all the blocks is possible when suppliers and partners are found, sales channels are determined and costs are calculated.

The creators of the tool (Osterwalder and Pinier) in their scientific work recommend that entrepreneurs do not limit themselves to drawing up one model. To find the best option, ask yourself difficult questions, take into account various scenarios of the company's development and then you will be able to choose the best business model that will have a positive effect on business development.
